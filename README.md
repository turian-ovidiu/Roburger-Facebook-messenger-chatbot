This is a simple Chatbot that simulates a burgers shop.


https://www.facebook.com/RoburgerChatbot/


I create this Chatbot using api.ai .


You can say something like : 

- You can see the Menu. ("show the menu")

- You can order burgers and sauces. ("I want to buy 2 Boston burgers medium size with extra BBQ sauce")

- You can see your order. ("my order" , "show me my order")

- You can cancel your order. ("cancel the order" , "stop the order")

- If your command looks good , you can send the order to delivery. ("send order" , "I want to deliver my order")



I hope you have a good experience playing with this chatbot.
If it has some errors , I will try to correct them.
Enjoy !
